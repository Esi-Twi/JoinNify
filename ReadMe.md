## 🎯 Project Title: Event Booking & Management System

Perfect 👏 — defining **pages and user flow** is one of the most important steps before you start building your **MERN Event Booking System**.

Below is a complete **page architecture + flow** designed to help you master the **MERN stack end-to-end**, from authentication to dashboards, payments, and admin control.

---

# 🌍 Overall Flow

Your system has **3 main roles**:

* 🧑‍💼 **Admin** — manages everything.
* 🎤 **Organizer** — creates and manages events.
* 🎟️ **Attendee (User)** — browses and books events.

We’ll organize the pages by **role** and **flow** — from landing page → authentication → main features → dashboards.

Would you like me to design a **site map diagram (visual flow)** for this — showing how all pages connect (like a flowchart you can use for documentation)? It’ll help you visualize how users move through the system.
