Perfect — building a **complete Event Booking System** is one of the *best ways* to master the **MERN stack** because it touches every core concept: authentication, CRUD, file uploads, payments, APIs, complex UI, and performance optimization.

Here’s a **complete breakdown** of how you can turn this project into a full MERN master project 👇

---

## 🎯 Project Title: Event Booking & Management System

### 🧠 Core Idea

A full-stack platform where organizers can create and manage events, attendees can browse and book tickets, and admins oversee everything. It will include payments, analytics, QR check-in, and more.

---

## 🚦1. Roles and Access Control

**Roles:**

* **Admin:** Manages everything — users, events, reports, and site settings.
* **Organizer:** Creates, edits, and manages their own events.
* **Attendee:** Browses, books, and checks into events.

**Concepts you’ll learn:**

* JWT-based authentication & refresh tokens
* Middleware-based role authorization
* Private and public routes in React
* Role-based dashboards

---

## 🧱 2. Event Creation & Management

**Organizer Features:**

* Create/edit/delete events (title, location, date, category, capacity, ticket price).
* Upload event banner images (use **Multer** or **Cloudinary**).
* Manage ticket sales and view attendees list.
* Duplicate events easily for recurring sessions.

**Concepts:**

* File upload handling
* Form data + image uploads
* MongoDB data relationships (user → event → tickets)
* React forms and controlled components

---

## 🎟️ 3. Ticket Booking and Payments

**Attendee Features:**

* Browse events (search, filter, paginate)
* View event details (description, map, time, organizer info)
* Book tickets and pay securely (Stripe or Paystack)
* Receive e-ticket via email (with QR code)

**Concepts:**

* Payment gateway integration
* Generating unique QR codes for tickets
* Email services (NodeMailer + templates)
* Protected purchase flow (prevent duplicate payments)

---

## 📱 4. QR Check-In System

**Use Case:**

* At the event, the organizer scans the attendee’s ticket QR code to mark them as “Checked In.”

**Concepts:**

* Generate and store QR codes in MongoDB
* Create a React QR scanner (use `react-qr-reader`)
* Update booking status in real-time using WebSockets (Socket.IO)

---

## ✉️ 5. Notifications and Emails

**Emails:**

* Registration confirmation
* Ticket purchase confirmation
* Event reminder (24h before start)
* Organizer sales report

**Notifications:**

* Real-time dashboard notifications for new sales or attendees
* System alerts (event deleted, payment failed, etc.)

**Concepts:**

* Email templates with Handlebars or EJS
* Cron jobs or scheduled tasks (e.g., `node-cron`)
* WebSocket-based notifications

---

## 🔍 6. Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination

**Attendee Side:**

* Filter by event category, date range, city, price, popularity
* Sort by date, newest, trending, etc.
* Paginated event list

**Concepts:**

* MongoDB queries + Mongoose pagination
* React Query or Axios caching for data fetching
* Dynamic filtering UI

---

## 📊 7. Analytics & Dashboards

**Admin Dashboard:**

* Total users, events, revenue
* Most active organizers
* Monthly ticket sales graph (using Recharts)

**Organizer Dashboard:**

* Event-level ticket sales graph
* Attendance rate and revenue insights

**Concepts:**

* Aggregation pipelines in MongoDB
* Chart rendering with Recharts or Chart.js
* Protected API endpoints for analytics

---

## ⚙️ 8. System Management (Admin Features)

**Admin Features:**

* Approve or reject organizer event submissions
* Manage users (ban/unban, reset password)
* Manage categories and featured events
* System-wide reports download (CSV, PDF)

**Concepts:**

* Data exports (CSV or Excel)
* Role management via Admin panel
* CRUD operations with modals and confirmation dialogs

---

## 🗂️ 9. Advanced Search and SEO

**Features:**

* Search events by keyword, tags, or location
* SEO-friendly event pages (React Helmet)
* Friendly URLs (`/events/music-festival-accra`)

**Concepts:**

* MongoDB full-text search
* URL slugs and React Router dynamic routes
* SEO optimization for React

---

## 🧩 10. Optional Advanced Add-ons

To push your skills even further, add:

* **Multi-language support (i18n)**
* **Dark mode toggle**
* **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — offline event browsing
* **Google Maps integration** for event location
* **Email verification and password reset flow**
* **Mobile responsiveness and lazy loading**
* **Docker setup** for deployment consistency
* **CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions**
* **Deployment on Render / Vercel / Railway**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack Summary

**Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS, React Router, React Query, Recharts
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
**Auth:** JWT + bcrypt
**File Uploads:** Multer + Cloudinary
